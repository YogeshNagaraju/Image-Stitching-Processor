# Image-Stitching-Processor
An OpenCV-based image stitching project that combines multiple images into a seamless panorama. The script loads images, stitches them together, and applies post-processing techniques like grayscale conversion, contour detection, and cropping to refine the final stitched output. Uses OpenCV and NumPy for efficient image processing.
